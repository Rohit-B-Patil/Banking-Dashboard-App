# ðŸ’° Simple Bank Account UI (Classic Redux)

A minimal React app that simulates a basic bank account system using **classic Redux** (v5). This project demonstrates Redux concepts without Redux Toolkit, managing state manually through reducers, action creators, and middleware.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Create a new bank account
- Deposit and withdraw funds
- Request a loan with a specific purpose
- Pay back an active loan
- Currency selection for deposits
- Async operations handled using `redux-thunk` (e.g., simulating currency conversion delays)

---

## ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Implemented

- Properly structured Redux-based application using **classic Redux (v5)**
- Integrated `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks for state access and action dispatching in React
- Manually defined **action creators**, **reducers**, and **Redux store**
- Used `redux-thunk` for handling asynchronous operations (e.g., currency conversion simulation)
- Built a clean and interactive UI with dynamic state updates for all account operations
- Styling done using standard **CSS**, without any CSS frameworks like Tailwind
